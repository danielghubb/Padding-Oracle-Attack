# Padding-Oracle-Attack

This project consists of a Java program (padding.java) and a Bash script for running the program.
The goal of this project is to exploit a Padding Oracle vulnerability by decrypting an encrypted message without knowledge of the encryption key.
This is achieved by repeatedly manipulating ciphertext blocks and observing server responses.
